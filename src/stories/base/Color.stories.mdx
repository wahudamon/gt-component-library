# Color

## Introduction

Our color system was designed to establish a flexible range of colors that support our brand, comms, and product teams. GT design team are on a full ranged color palette which includes many shades for each color.

## Color Principles

### Accessible

We go to great lengths to ensure that every color we use meets accessibility standards. both in terms of external accessibility (how easy it is for all users to see color combinations) and internal accessibility (how easy it is for designers and developers to find and use palettes).

### Hierarchial

Existing colors can indicate which elements are interactive, and make it easier for users to know more deeply the differences between one element and another.

### Clarity

With existing colors, all elements like text, icons, etc. legibility, clarity and having a sharp focus on functionality motivates the design.

## Primary

The primary colors are the most used colors across the brand and UI designs. These colors can be combined with shade colors which is used as accents.

## Secondary

These colours appear far less frequently, and act more like accent colours. Secondary colour are often used in the case of complex data visualisation or graphs. Secondary colours are optional, but they provide more opportunities to distinguish your product. For example, by adding in a secondary colour, we can make our UI more interesting.

## Neutrals

Neutrals have a supportive role in UI design — these colours are usually made for text and background. In Material design, instead of defining specific code for black or grey, they use the opacity of black to apply typography a value. In other words, they use the ‘shades’ approach mentioned above.

## Semantic Colors

These are the colors that communicate purpose. They help users convey messages. For example, Green has a positive connotation. We use Green to convey success, confirmation messages, etc.

## Accessibility

Using various forms of contrast is the most important consideration when making user-friendly color and interface choices. Awareness of standards and best practices is the key to accessible color selection.

The full color palette contain some values from 50 to 900 and some palette have values more than the other. Black text is WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guideline) AA accessible on colors ranging from 0 to 500 while white text is accessible on colors from 600 to 900/1200.
